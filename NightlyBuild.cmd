======================================================================
Perform a clean build, run tests and create NuGet packages for this
solution. Note that this also modifies the following file, replacing
placeholder version numbers with actual version numbers:
    src\common\GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs

(see the SetVersionNumber task in xunit.performance.msbuild)

This file will, therefore, show up as modified after the build.
Be careful NOT to check it in that way!

If you publish these packages to Nuget, then please remember to
bump the build number on BuildSemanticVersion below.
